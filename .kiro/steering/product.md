# Product Overview

Claude Code Spec-Driven Development is a comprehensive framework that implements Kiro-style specification-driven development workflows within Claude Code using hooks and slash commands.

## Core Features

- **3-Phase Approval Workflow**: Requirements → Design → Tasks → Implementation with mandatory human review at each phase
- **Intelligent Steering System**: Automated creation and maintenance of project knowledge documents (product, tech, structure)
- **Slash Command Toolset**: 7 specialized commands for managing the complete spec-driven development lifecycle
- **Automated Progress Tracking**: Hook-based system for monitoring task completion and specification compliance
- **Multi-language Support**: Complete documentation and configurations in Japanese, English, and Traditional Chinese
- **Context Preservation**: Smart context management during Claude Code session compression
- **Project Template System**: Ready-to-use examples and templates for quick project setup

## Target Use Case

This framework is designed for software development teams and individual developers who want to:

- **Maintain consistency** across AI-assisted development sessions
- **Ensure quality** through structured review processes
- **Track progress** transparently on complex feature development
- **Preserve project knowledge** through persistent steering documents
- **Follow systematic development** rather than ad-hoc coding approaches
- **Integrate AI assistance** into established development workflows

The system is particularly valuable for:
- Complex feature development requiring multiple development sessions
- Team environments where project knowledge needs to be shared
- Long-term projects where architectural decisions need documentation
- Quality-focused development requiring structured review processes

## Key Value Proposition

**Bridging the gap between Kiro IDE's advanced spec-driven development and Claude Code's powerful AI assistance.** 

The framework provides:
- **Structured AI Collaboration**: Transforms ad-hoc AI interactions into systematic development processes
- **Knowledge Persistence**: Maintains project context across sessions through steering documents
- **Quality Assurance**: Enforces human review at critical development phases
- **Automation with Control**: Automates routine tasks while preserving human oversight
- **Proven Methodology**: Implements battle-tested Kiro development patterns in Claude Code environment

This enables developers to achieve the same level of systematic, high-quality development that Kiro users enjoy, while leveraging Claude Code's accessibility and powerful AI capabilities.
